Notes on how I'm testing the developing program intepreting feature in Swift DeadEnds.

Overview:

1. If the C command that converts DeadEnds scripts to S-Expressions changes, run the command:
          getgensexprs
   It copies the C program from XCode's derived data to my bin with the name 'gensexprs'.

2. To change the test program edit the file:
          /Users/ttw4/Desktop/DeadEndsVSCode/Scripts/sexprtest

3. To convert the test program to S-Expressions run the command:
          rungensexprs
   This runs the gensexprs command on the program and write the S-Expression to file
          /Users/ttw4/xfer

4. Run the DeadEndsSwift target ReadPNodes
