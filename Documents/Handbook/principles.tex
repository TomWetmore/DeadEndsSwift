\section{DeadEnds}
\subsection{Introduction}

DeadEnds is a software package for genealogical computing written in
the Swift language.
It is based loosely on LifeLines, a genealogical program written in
C in the 1990s.

\subsection{Gedcom and Database}

Gedcom is a language for storing genealogical data in computer files.
There are several official and non-official standards for Gedcom.
DeadEnds attempts to accommodate as many
standards as possible.

DeadEnds uses a non-persistent, in-RAM database to hold genealogical
data when program is running. The database disappears when
the program finishes.

The backing store for DeadEnds programs are the Gedcom files. When a
DeadEnd programs begins one or more Gedcom files are read via the
DeadEnds \emph{import stack} into one or more databases.
Those files maybe rewritten when the program finishes.
