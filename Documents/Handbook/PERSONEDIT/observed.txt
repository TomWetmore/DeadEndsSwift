We‚Äôll pull back the curtain on how @ObservedObject and @Published work under the hood.

Big Picture
	‚Ä¢	@State is for local view-owned state.
	‚Ä¢	@ObservedObject is for external state, owned by another class.
	‚Ä¢	@Published marks which properties on that class should notify views when they change.

The key concept here is observation: a view ‚Äúwatches‚Äù an object, and automatically re-renders when that object changes.


How the Pieces Fit.
You typically have a class like this:

class PersonEditorViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name: String = ""
    @Published var sex: SexType? = nil
}

And a view like this:

struct PersonFormView: View {
    @ObservedObject var vm: PersonEditorViewModel
    var body: some View {
        TextField("Name", text: $vm.name)
    }
}

Let‚Äôs Break That Down

1. @ObservedObject
This tells SwiftUI: ‚ÄúThis view doesn‚Äôt own the model, but it wants to watch it for changes.‚Äù

What happens internally:
	‚Ä¢	The view stores a reference to the object (usually a class).
	‚Ä¢	It subscribes to changes using the ObservableObjectPublisher.
	‚Ä¢	When a property changes, the view is invalidated and redrawn.
The object must conform to ObservableObject.

2. ObservableObject Protocol. This is a marker protocol:

protocol ObservableObject: AnyObject {
    var objectWillChange: ObservableObjectPublisher { get }
}

When your view model changes something, this publisher emits a signal to the view system.

üß† In simpler terms:
It‚Äôs a notification center for property changes.

‚∏ª

3. @Published

This is how your object notifies observers that a property changed.

@Published var name: String = ""

Under the hood, this:
	‚Ä¢	Stores the value.
	‚Ä¢	Sets up a Publisher that emits whenever the value is changed.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically hooks into ObservableObjectPublisher if the object conforms to ObservableObject.

üí• So when you do:

vm.name = "Alice"

SwiftUI gets notified before the change happens and marks the view for redrawing.

üß¨ A Rough Manual Equivalent

If you wanted to do this yourself without any SwiftUI magic, you‚Äôd write something like:

class MyViewModel {
    var name: String {
        willSet { notifyObservers() }
    }

    func notifyObservers() {
        // Notify all views to redraw
    }
}

SwiftUI wraps all of this in:
	‚Ä¢	@Published: to wrap individual properties
	‚Ä¢	ObservableObject: to coordinate the whole object
	‚Ä¢	@ObservedObject: to connect the view to the object

‚∏ª

üö¶ When Should You Use @ObservedObject?

Use it when:
	‚Ä¢	The source of truth lives outside the view.
	‚Ä¢	You want multiple views to share and respond to the same data.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre working with a view model (especially in MVVM).

üîÅ Comparison to @StateObject

Usage
Description
@ObservedObject
The view does not own the object. It just observes changes.
@StateObject
The view creates and owns the object. It is responsible for its lifecycle.

üß† Visual Diagram

Here‚Äôs a flow of change propagation:

User types ‚Üí TextField ‚Üí updates $vm.name (Binding)
  ‚Üì
@Published detects the change
  ‚Üì
ObservableObjectPublisher sends signal
  ‚Üì
SwiftUI redraws any View using @ObservedObject vm

‚úÖ Summary for observer.txt

- @ObservedObject lets a View observe a reference type (class) that conforms to ObservableObject.
- ObservableObject has a built-in notification center: objectWillChange.
- @Published marks a property as triggering change notifications.
- Together, this creates a reactive pipeline:
    - View observes model
    - Model publishes changes
    - View updates automatically
- Similar to "listener" patterns in other UI systems, but declarative.
- Use @ObservedObject when you don‚Äôt own the model.
- Use @StateObject when you do own the model.
