# DeadEndsSwift

DeadEndsSwift is a macOS genealogy software system consisting of a core genealogical library and applications and command line programs that use the library.

DeadEnds is written in Swift using SwiftUI in the application examples. It is the successor to my C-based DeadEnds project which was the successor to my C-based LifeLines program written back in the 1990's. DeadEnds supports reading Gedcom files, building an in-memory genealogical database, and visualizing family relationships.

## Features
- Reads Gedcom files into internal (in-RAM) databases.
- Displays Person, Family, and Pedigree views.
- Supports editing of genealogical data -- adding, deleting and modifying records, adding, removing and changing family relatioships.
- Support an internal scripting language.

## Status
Currently under active development â€” not all features are complete.
