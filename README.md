# DeadEndsSwift

DeadEndsSwift is a macOS genealogy application written in Swift using SwiftUI.  
It is the successor to my C-based DeadEnds project which was the successor to my LifeLines software of the 1990's. DeadEnds supports reading Gedcom files, building an in-memory genealogical database, and visualizing family relationships.

## Features
- Reads Gedcom files into internal (in-RAM) databases.
- Displays Person, Family, and Pedigree views.
- Supports editing of genealogical data -- adding, deleting and modifying records, adding, removing and changing family relatioships.
- Support an internal scripting language.

## Status
Currently under active development â€” not all features are complete.

## License
(TBD)
